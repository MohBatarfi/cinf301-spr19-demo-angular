# AngularDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Prerequisites 

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ® and an npm package manager.

#### Node.js
To get Node.js, go to nodejs.org.

### npm package manager
Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages. To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.

To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window.

To download and install nmp packages enter the following command in your terminal:

<pre>npm install</pre>

## To create projects

1) Install the Angular CLI

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:

<pre>npm install -g @angular/cli </pre>

2) Create a workspace and initial application

Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here:

<pre>ng new my-app</pre>

3) Serve the application

Go to the workspace folder (my-app).

<pre>cd my-app</pre>

Launch the server by using the CLI command ng serve, with the --open option.

<pre>ng serve --open</pre>

The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files

## To run this Demo

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If port 4200 is already in use, you can run the command line ng serve --port 'number of port' and navigate to `http://localhost:'number of port'/`
